\section{Introduction and state of the art}

Evolution seems to be an effective method for improve, therefore optimice, behaviours. To use computers for emulate the biological evolution has became an excellent tool for problem solving named evolutionary programming, evolution strategies, artificial life and genetic algorithms (GA). For doing so the scientific community has been produced several libraries of diverse quality and applied it in many domains.

This article centered on \emph{Genetic Algorithms} as domain of application and will not develop any theory about that. Nevertheless the principal concepts involved and it's characteristics most be told in order to show how was modeled by Erlang constructs.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: next section
presents the state of the resolution of the MasterMind puzzle and its
evolution, having special emphasis in its evolutionary solutions; we will
explain then the general characteristics of the evolutionary algorithm
used to solve MasterMind in this work. Results obtained with this setup will be
presented in Section \ref{sec:results}, and we will finish the paper
with the conclusions that derive from them (commented in Section
\ref{sec:conclusions}).




\section{Implementing an evolutionary algorithm in a concurrent functional language}
\label{sec:evo}

A varied arsenal of programming patterns, i.e., paradigms, exist for implement the algorithms models. EAs are characterized by an intensive use of strings (lists of some kind) for encoding genes, the existence of populations that evolve by herself and the variation of criterias for selection trough time. An programming language whose characteristics fits these needs will be highly appreciated.

\subsection{Erlang characterization}

There is a claim in modern software development for programming languages that help with concurrent programming and with better abstractions. The functional programming language Erlang is an answer that provides the actor pattern concept for concurrency and the functional paradigm for general modeling and design of solutions.

Actors are a concurrent unit of execution using asynchronous messages passing for communication, for been implemented as process in the VM of the language and not like OS thread are very lightweight in creation, live and death. The use of immutable messages eliminate many of the typical problems of concurrent development and support the emulation of the Object Oriented paradigm with his modeling facilities. Functional programming has been defined by the role of functions in program composition and by the use of the very efficient lists data structure with many high order functions that operate upon it, Erlang honored the functional linage and include a ultra fast distributed data base. Besides, Erlang posees a macro system and the concept of records for encapsulate coding patterns and to group data by an entity.


\subsection{Genetic Algorithm mapping to Erlang}

The implementation of a genetic algorithm in a functional language most follow a different path, that's means to structure the algorithm model in terms less imperative and more declarative. We going to use a parallel pool based evolutionary strategy\cite{DBLP:conf/3pgcic/GuervosMFEL12} as use case in order to show our mean.

The pool (a server) will be an execution entity that will own the population and keep track of the advance in the solution search. The clients, concurrents to, that do the calculations could join and leave at any time without any consequences. Chromosomes will be encoding like lists and the differents steps of the EAs resides on Erlang functions.
