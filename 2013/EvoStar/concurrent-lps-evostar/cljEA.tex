
We developed a library in Clojure following the same design concepts and it was tested with the case study. The code is open, under AGPL license, at \url{https://github.com/jalbertcruz/cljEA/tree/evostar2014}. This implementation uses the same naming and architectural convection as in Erlang and Scala.
