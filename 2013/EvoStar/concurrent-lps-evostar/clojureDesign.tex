The Clojure’s main concurrent concepts used are agent, ref and atom; the functional ones are function and list. Clojure is a language with a very strict control of state change; it demands a clear identification of the code doing it and that’s similar to Erlang where the functional purity is pursued too.

Agents were the concept used for implement the independent units of execution (reproductors, evaluators and islands). The communication between agents was made by protocol’s functions due to the flexibility need. GA’s operations, their logic and constraints, were express in functions and protocol’s implementations and the data was encoded in lists and vectors data structures.
