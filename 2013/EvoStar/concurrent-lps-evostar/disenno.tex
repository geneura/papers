
In order to design the architecture of a software in the GAs application domain, we mostly identify the main concepts involved and the relations among them. Then, using the concepts of the paradigms and programming techniques chosen, we define the structure from the highest levels of abstraction indicating the data to be processed and their flow. The quality and extensibility of that structure might determine the succeed or failure of the software.

The main GAâ€™s components identified in that work for designing our proposal are listed in Table \ref{agpComp}.

On the other hand, to develop an optimal codification of an algorithm is mandatory to know every characteristic of the programming language in use.

In this work we used hybrid pGAs: an island topology with a pool based pGA in each node. We chose the {\em Max-SAT} problem with 100 variable instances \cite{Hoos2000}.
