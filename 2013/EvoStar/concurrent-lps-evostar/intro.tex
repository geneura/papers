
\noindent Genetic algorithms (GA) are currently one of the most used meta-heuristics to solve Computer Science problems. They can obtain solutions to complex optimizations problems in adequate times \cite{Luque2011}. These algorithms consists in evolving sets of individuals (populations), as it is on nature, to find or improve a solution to a problem.

Parallel genetic algorithms (pGAs) are GAs in which the possible solutions are evaluated or the process of evolution is made in parallel. It is especially useful for problems with complex fitness functions but some researchers are found \cite{Alba2001} it’s improve the quality of solutions.

The field is rich in features, several models have been created and new kind of problems are have been tried to solve, nevertheless the programming paradigm used in the implementation of such algorithms is far from being an object of study. Technologies like Java and C/C++ are mostly used, and, even when some researchers show that implementation matters \cite{DBLP:conf/iwann/MereloRACML11}, to approach new languages/paradigms it is not normally seen as a land for scientific improvements.

The multicore’s challenge \cite{SutterL05} is a current need for making parallel even the simplest program. But this way leads us to use and create design patterns for parallel algorithms; the conversion of a pattern into a language feature is a common practice in the programming languages domain, and sometimes that’s means a language modification, others the creation of a new one.

This work explores the advantages of some non mainstream languages with concurrent and functional features in order to develop GAs \cite{GA_Goldberg89} in its parallel versions. It is motivated by the lack of community attention on the subject and the belief that using concepts that simplify the modeling and implementation of such algorithms it might promote their use in research (achieving a paradigm shift to create more efficient algorithms) and in practice (for being the implementations of the parallels variants very simple).

This research tries to show some possible areas of improvement on architecture and engineering best practices for functional-concurrent paradigms like it has been on OO \cite{EO:FEA2000}, by focusing on GAs as a domain of application and describing how their principal traits can be modeled by means of functional-concurrent languages constructs. We are continuing the research reported in \cite{DBLP:conf/gecco/CruzGGC13,J.Albert-Cruz2013}.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Next section
presents the state of the art in parallel software platforms (programming languages paradigms) and its potential for evolutionary algorithms. Our
adaptation of GAs to the paradigms and a case study results is explained in section \ref{sec:design}. Finally, we draw some conclusions and propose future lines of work in section \ref{sec:conclusions}.
