
Develop correct software quickly is a never ending goal in the software industry. There are two no-mainstream programming paradigms: the functional and the concurrent, trying to make a difference providing new abstraction tools. The functional languages are available since a long time (LISP is a very old programming language) nevertheless their use has been limited mainly for the inefficiency of theirs compilers or interpreters. Currently these situations have change, the problems solved and the advantages have promoting the inclusions of several functional concepts in modern and mainstream languages, C\# for example, or even the creation of new ones (Clojure).

Among the emergent languages with the concurrent paradigm excels Clojure, Go, Scala, Haskell and Erlang \cite{Nov.-Dec.2012}; they have built-in programming constructs for manage concurrency simplifying his correct use.
