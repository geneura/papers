
The concurrent programming paradigm (or concurrent oriented programming \cite{Armstrong2003}) is characterized by the presence of programming constructs for manage process like first class objects. That’s with operators for act upon them and the possibility of using it like parameters or function's result values.

Concurrent programming is hard for many reasons, the communication between processes is central in the design of such algorithms. One of the best efforts to formalize and simplify that is the Hoare’s {\em Communicating Sequential Processes} \cite{Hoare:1978:CSP:359576.359585}, this interaction description language are the theorical support for many libraries  and new programming languages.
