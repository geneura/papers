
The concurrent programming paradigm (or concurrent oriented programming \cite{Armstrong2003}) is characterized by the presence of programming constructs for managing processes like first class objects. That is, with operators for acting upon them and the possibility of using them like parameters or function's result values.

Concurrent programming is hard for many reasons, the communication between processes is key in the design of such algorithms. One of the best efforts to formalize and simplify that is the Hoareâ€™s {\em Communicating Sequential Processes} \cite{Hoare:1978:CSP:359576.359585}, this interaction description language is the theoretical support for many libraries  and new programming languages.
