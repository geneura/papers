
We developed a library in Scala following the same design concepts and it was tested with the case study. The code is open, under AGPL license, at \url{https://github.com/jalbertcruz/sclEA/tree/evostar2014}. The main classes and objects are briefly described.

% ¿Por qué no se separan las clases explicadas abajo?
% Evaluator class
% Reproducer class
% These two kinds of actors...

\subsubsection{Evaluator/Reproducer's classes}

The reproducer class select the subpopulation and parents for reproduction, it does the crossover and activate migrations. As actor respond to {\em evolve} and {\em emigrateBest} messages, for iteration and migration operations.

Class {\em Evaluator} consults the pool constantly looking for no-evaluated individuals. It is compound by the function {\em evaluate/1} (general evaluation function), and the message: {\em evaluate} for fire the calculation.

These two kinds of actors are the executing units working to reach the solutions. They have, concerning architecture, the same role than Erlang’s actors, with the same behavior but in an object oriented way.
