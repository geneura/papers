@book{RoR:Agile,
	abstract = {{Rails is a full-stack, open-source web framework
                  that enables you to create full-featured,
                  sophisticated web-based applications, but with a
                  twist... A full Rails application probably has less
                  total code than the XML you'd need to configure the
                  same application in other frameworks.    With this
                  book you'll learn how to use <i>ActiveRecord</i> to
                  connect business objects and database tables.  No
                  more painful object-relational mapping.  Just create
                  your business objects and let Rails do the rest.
                  You'll learn how to use the <i>Action Pack</i>
                  framework to route incoming requests and render
                  pages using easy-to-write templates and
                  components. See how to exploit the Rails service
                  frameworks to send emails, implement web services,
                  and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using
                  built-in Javascript and Ajax support. There are
                  extensive chapters on testing, deployment, and
                  scaling.    You'll see how easy it is to install
                  Rails using your web server of choice (such as
                  Apache or lighttpd) or using its own included web
                  server.  You'll be writing applications that work
                  with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle,
                  Postgres, and more) in no time at all.    You'll
                  create a complete online store application in the
                  extended tutorial section, so you'll see how a full
                  Rails application is developed---iteratively and
                  rapidly.    Rails strives to honor the Pragmatic
                  Programmer's "DRY Principle" by avoiding the extra
                  work of configuration files and code annotations.
                  You can develop in real-time: make a change, and
                  watch it work immediately.    Forget XML.
                  Everything in Rails, from templates to control flow
                  to business logic, is written in Ruby, the language
                  of choice for programmers who like to get the job
                  done well (and leave work on time for a change).
                  Rails is the framework of choice for the new
                  generation of Web 2.0 developers. <em>Agile Web
                  Development with   Rails</em> is the book for that
                  generation, written by Dave Thomas (Pragmatic
                  Programmer and author of <em>Programming Ruby</em>)
                  and David Heinemeier Hansson, who created Rails.}},

@book{js:reference,
	abstract = {{At 4.5 by 7 inches in size and only 89 pages long, the aptly named <I>JavaScript Pocket Reference</I> will really almost fit in your pocket. Use this guide as a companion to turn to when you're in doubt about that function syntax or you're drawing a blank on the JavaScript object model.<p> The book concisely packs together the syntax of the scripting language, including summaries of expression and statement style. The real meat of the tiny title is an alphabetical listing of JavaScript objects, along with their associated methods, properties, and events. One nice feature of this section is the attention to the varying support between Microsoft and Netscape browser versions. However, this listing is useful only if you know what object you want to work with. Missing from the reference is a solutions-based reference to let you refresh your memory about how to do a particular task, such as validate a form field or roll over a graphic when the user moves the mouse.<p> One drawback is the book's illustration of the object model--done only in a small diagram. This is a bit of a shame since this is one of the key topics most developers need help with. If you're rather familiar with JavaScript, this pocket reference will be helpful. New coders, however, will likely find it insufficient. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I>} {JavaScript--the powerful, object-based scripting language that can be embedded directly into HTML pages--has earned its place in the web developer's toolkit, to the extent that it's now considered required knowledge for web developers.  You can use JavaScript to create dynamic, interactive applications that run completely within a web browser.  JavaScript is also the language of choice for developing Dynamic HTML content.  Because its syntax is based on the popular programming languages C, C++, and Java, JavaScript is familiar and easy to learn for experienced programmers. At the same time, it's an interpreted scripting language, providing a flexible, forgiving programming environment for new programmers.  <p>The <i>JavaScript Pocket Reference</i>, 2nd Edition provides a complete overview of the core JavaScript language and client-side scripting environment, as well as quick-reference material on core and client-side objects, methods, and properties.  The new edition has been revised to cover JavaScript 1.5, and is particularly useful for developers working with the latest standards-compliant web browsers, such as Internet Explorer 6, Netscape 7, and Mozilla.  Ideal as an introduction for beginners and a quick reference for advanced developers, this pocket-sized book is easy to take anywhere and serves as the perfect companion volume to the bestselling <i>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</i>, 4th Edition.<p>O'Reilly's Pocket References have become a favorite among developers everywhere.  By providing a wealth of important details in a concise, well-organized format, these handy books deliver just what you need to complete the task at hand. When you've reached a sticking point and need to get to the answer quickly, the new <i>JavaScript Pocket Reference</i> is the book you'll want close at hand.} {JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that can be embedded directly in HTML. It allows you to create dynamic, interactive Web-based applications that run completely within a Web browser.<p>The <i>JavaScript Pocket Reference</i> is a companion volume to <i>JavaScript:  The Definitive Guide.</i> This small book, covering JavaScript 1.2,  is a handy reference guide to this popular language for Web development. It  provides a complete overview of the core JavaScript language and contains summaries of both core and client-side objects, methods,  and properties.}},

  abstract =     "Evolutionary algorithms are powerful optimisation
                 methods and have been applied successfully in many
                 scientific areas including life sciences. However, they
                 have high computational demands. In order to alleviate
                 this, parallel evolutionary algorithms have been
                 developed. Unfortunately, the implementation of
                 parallel evolutionary algorithms can be complicated,
                 and often requires specific hardware and software
                 environments. This frequently results in very
                 problem-specific parallel evolutionary algorithms with
                 little scope for reuse. This paper investigates the use
                 of the JavaSpaces technology to overcome these
                 problems. This technology is free of charge, simplifies
                 the implementation of parallel/distributed
                 applications, and is independent of hardware and
                 software environments. Several approaches for the
                 implementation of different parallel evolutionary
                 algorithms using JavaSpaces are proposed and
                 successfully tested.",
