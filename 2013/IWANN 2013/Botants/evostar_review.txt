Summary: This paper presents a method followed to implement a strategy for an ant submitted for the Google AI challenge and an improvement of the proposed strategy by utilizing GA. The proposed technique is then compared with three other ants submitted for the same competition.

Details: The authors should be clear about the main innovation of the paper and how it advances the state-of-the-art.

Section 3: there is no Figure 4.3! Ok

Figure 1: it would be nice to say what the colors in the figure stand for. Ok

Section 4.1: More discussion about the basic strategy is required. How do you apply the prioritization? And how does the ant perform each of these task?

La implementación Greedy es una de las implementaciones de ejemplo proporcionadas por la organización.
La selección de las opciones básicas se realiza de forma jerárquica:
  1) Si hay hormiguero enemigo a la vista, atacar hormiguero, si no
  2) Si hay comida a la vista, recoger la comida, si no
  3) Si hay hormigas enemigas que atacar, atacar a las hormigas enemigas, si no
  4) Si hay zonas desconocidas a la vista, ir a las zonas desconocidas, si no
  5) moverse de forma aleatoria

You mentioned that, according to the competition rules, the ants are not allowed to store any information about its former actions. Having said so, how do you calculate the “turn lefty” parameter?!
Para poder evolucionar nuestro algoritmo, hemos añadido una capa que nos permite guardar el material genético de los mejores individuos y poder evolucionarlos en las siguientes partidas. En el contexto de la competición, esta evolución se realizaría offline en ordenadores locales, y tras la evolución del algoritmo se subiría a la plataforma con el fin de continuar con la competición oficial online.


Section 4.2: what do you mean by “my ants”, the number of ants? ok Yes

How do you apply the hierarchical fitness? Is it a weighted sum of the proposed factors? How exactly is the final fitness calculated?
PABLO

Table 1: what do you mean by “Rows”and “Cols”, what features of the map do they represent? Ok Map size

Section 4.4: how many times you run evolution on each map? ok 10 times, 20 generations

Tables 2 to 5 appear to present standard deviations; over how many runs these have been calculated? And why most of them are equals to 0 for maxScore?

Esto no se muy bien que poner. La desviación se calcula sobre los resultados finales
de las ejecuciones. Por esta razón aparece un 0 en muchos casos. Después de la evolución
siempre la puntuación es la misma, por eso la desviación sale 0. Hay poca variación de puntuación.

Section 5 presents a comparison between the proposed approach and ant from the competition while the abstract states that a comparison against only two agents will be presented.

Cierto, inicialmente se habla de dos competidores pero finalmente se emplean 3.
 
"To conduct the evolution (in the evaluation step), every candidate agent in the
population has combated against two di?erent enemies (in two di?erent approaches): 
a deterministic agent who ?nished in rank 993, and a very competitive agent which 
got position 165."
 

I assume that Bot1 is the winner of the competition. How come your ant performs better than this bot while worse than the other two (who scores less in the competition)?
No entiendo esto. Bot1 es mejor que el nuestro en todos los casos.
Why there is no table that presents the results of the basic agent vs. the Bot1?


It is hard to understand and analyze the results without introducing the other agents and briefly discuss their techniques. I understand that this information might not be easily accessible but in this case a discussion about their behavior and the main differences between them and the proposed ant is appreciated.

No es posible conocer esta información durante la competición. La idea es poder
aplicar este método en futuras competiciones. La lucha se realiza contra un bot
del que desconocemos la estrategia.

Summary: This paper reports about work in progress about an agent for the ANTS game which was used as the Google Challenge 2011. The agent has to control the actions of ants on a map (as in a strategy game) over food resources and map domination.

The actual paper is about evolving parameters of a otherwise fixed behaviour agent.

Details: While this is a solidly written paper, and the problem is clearly interesting, I find the approach a bit too simplistic to be published at a conference about evolutionary computing.

The four evolved parameters, as the authors state, do not permit a diverse enough set of strategies to beat a variety of bots (especially the high ranked ones).

The "future work" section basically states the flaws of this paper, and what would make this paper interesting: adaptivity, map analysis, using a non trivial genome to evolve etc.

Summary: This paper presents the application of a GA for the ANTS Google AI challenge. In particular the GA tunes the parameters of a FSM-type of controller. The algorithm is tested across 6 different maps and thee different opponent bots and results obtained show that GA parameter tuning is beneficial for the performance of the bots. Two fitness functions are tested showing the superiority of the hierarchical one. The experimental methodology appears to be sound and the key finding shows that the GA-designed bot can beat opponents ranked 1000 positions higher.

Details: There are many language problems in the paper that the authors need to fix at the camera ready

The paper is limited in scope: what can we learn from this agent and this method? What can we learn from the ANTS benchmark? How useful are the results to game research and AI research? Why do we need better/more intelligent characters in such games at the first place? I am not convinced we do.
