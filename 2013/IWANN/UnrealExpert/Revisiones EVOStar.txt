Summary: The authors use draw on the expertise of a skilled Unreal Tournament player to construct a UT bot, which they then evolve the parameters for. I'm not convinced.

Details: Building on the knowledge of a skilled player is an interesting approach, somewhat reminiscent of the classical method of constructing expert systems. The section describing the E-bot is the most interesting, in my opinion. However, that section is unfortunately quite badly written and a bit hard to follow. In the end, it seems that the bot doesn't really do anything very fancy - stay away from enemy when health is low, attack when health is high. I know there are many rules in your bot, but you could certainly do a better job of describing them so the reader might learn something.

Given the large amount of previous work using UT2k4/Pogamut, I would have expected a better related works section. Also, to say that Quake was the first game in which "autonomous characters" were used is just laughable.

Further, with all the previous work available, one would have thought that you would have been able to test your bot against some of the other bots that have been submitted to competitions - not just the built-in bots. Please show us how your results compare to those in the literature.

In 4.3, I think you are really messing things up if you have to resort to such a complicated fitness function.

In the conclusions: what do we learn from this paper? Why was it necessary for me to read it? I know this is work in progress, but it is also a paper - make it worth reading!

Summary: This paper presents the use of GA to evolve parameters for an AI bot for the Unreal Tournament competition. The authors’ propose different chromosome representations and evaluate them in matches against another AI bot.

Details: Section 3: the paragraph starting with “It is important to point out that we…“ is a repetition and should be removed.

You mentioned that respawning is eliminated as part of the competition rules and that your agent takes this into consideration, then in the next section you discuss the importance of respawn timing and that this factor should be taken into consideration! You need to be consistent.

Section 4.1: what is the basis on which you decided how many genes you need for each of the factors you consider? And what do these genes represent?

You mentioned that you use 3 genes for distance. Why 3 genes? And distance to what?

It is not clear how the right figure in Fig.1 is better than the left one. The same y-scale should be used to facilitate better visualization and understanding. 

The paper is hard to understand without introducing FSM and its structure and parameters. This whole section is missing and without it the paper is clearly incomplete.

The main aim of the competition is to build a bot that plays in a human-like manner. The bots have been evaluated in matches against an AI bot with the purpose of winning and no evaluation was performed on the human-likeness of the bot.

Summary: This paper describes a Unreal Tournament 2004 bot. Rather than the objective of the 2K bot prize to pass a turing test, this paper solely focusses on the win rate of the bot. The authors present a FSM logic based on expert knowledge and in a second step evolve the internal parameters (thresholds) of said FSM using a genetic algorithm.

Details: The basic problem of creating agents that play first person shooters on a sufficient high level as humans do is not considered a "solved" problem. Along with the human-likeness of an agent this is still ongoing research in the community hence this paper tackles an interesting problem. From a evolutionary computing perspective the evolution of FSM parameters using a genetic algorithm isn't really interesting, but I give the paper the credits that considering item timings (the frequency and when important items spawn in the game world) is a new aspect that hasn't been considered before in the academic community to my knowledge. And as a former Unreal Tournament amateur league player, I can confirm that this is actually an important aspect of the game.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed with this paper:
- Please elaborate on the genome definition. What values are you evolving exactly?
- Why are the fitness functions defined the way they are? I get that the KD ratio is important for the bot fitnesses.
- How does the E-Bot tackle the hardest problem in the game, the spatial navigation? If your bot doesn't do one of the most basic moves (jumping), how do you expect him to beat any decent player?
- How does the evolved bot differ from your baseline E-Bot? Describe the characteristics which changed (which threshold, did I camp the shield or whatever)
- Human-likeness: The last paragraph of section2 claims that your bot is "human like". Please elaborate on this, or clarify that this is a future direction of research. It might be a phrasing ambiguity, and you actually meant "modelled after human expertise".
- Spelling and style: the paper has a lot of grammar and spelling errors. Also avoid vague generalising phrases like "Weapons in UT2K4 have been ‘carefully’ designed to be all of them equally useful and important (as a di?erence to other games)" - what is simply untrue.
- Two minor hints in case you're using Latex: quotation marks are entered like ``this'' not like 'this'. And as a common consensus, figures have their captions below, tables have their captions above them.
