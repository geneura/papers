\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The development of new intelligent systems that inform of traffic conditions and the affluence of vehicles on roads is becoming a key point for both public and private companies~\cite{El-Faouzi-2010}. According to Afandizadeh et al.~\cite{Afandizadeh-2012}, a critical task  any new intelligent transportation systems should face is short-term traffic flow prediction. Thus, traffic flow forecasting allows proactive strategies for managements systems (as control of signal priority) as well as for drivers guidance systems.

In this work, an information system of the traffic status is
proposed. This information system is based on data collected by means
of bluetooth (BT) device discovery and provides description of the
current traffic conditions, as well as a valuable dataset suitable to
be used in a time-series forecasting process. % DeberÌais hacer aquÌ
                                % alg˙n "claim" sobre quÈ es lo que va
                                % a hacer ese sistema, sus pros y sus

                                % - JJ

The data-collecting and the time-series forecasting processes [REF] 
% Antonio - poner una referencia y contar en una lÌnea lo que son
are necessary steps to achieve an ultimate goal: to have information
about traffic flows that occur or will occur in a certain area,
allowing or aiming to optimally manage motion decisions by citizens. 

% therefore de quÈ? - JJ
Therefore, from the transport management viewpoint, various needs have been addressed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item To have a versatile, autonomous data collector, and monitoring device.
  \item To collect traffic information in real time.
  \item To process in an adequate way the data being collected,
  \item And finally, to build a system that allows sharing data and information with those who make decisions about mobility.
% Antonio - øa quienes te refieres? :D
\end{itemize}

In order to fulfil these requirements, the BT device discovery used
for this work is able to catch pulses emitted by different
technological components. The components can be the ones embedded in
vehicles (hands-free or GPS), accessories that the users incorporate
to their vehicles, as well as mobile phones, tablets or laptops.  % decir las limitaciones que tienen estos ˙ltimos - JJ
The main data being collected is the MAC address of the device BT card.
This is an unique identifier for each device, so that passing vehicles
can be identified. % and, since itis unique, allows us to know whether
                   % the vehicle has been in different places - JJ 
From the user's personal data protection point of view, the
invasion of privacy is minimum since one-way encryption (or codification)
algorithms are used to hide the real MAC addresses which are
stored. Moreover it is even safer from the point of view of data
privacy, since this piece of information can not be attached to any
given person. 

The work shows how the large amount of data collected, related to
detected BT devices (which pass near the device), are considered as
the starting point to  compute statistics, to study several indicators
about the use of vehicles, and to perform time-series forecasting for
the monitored area population. % No digas lo que vas a hacer. Di por

\section{Background and State of the Art}
\label{sec:soa}
This section introduces the two main components of the work. On the
one hand, the methods developed to detect and store data about traffic flows; and on the other hand, the algorithms and techniques considered in the time-series prediction tasks.

\subsection{Traffic detection technologies}
\label{subsec:traffic}

% Esto deberÌa ir antes del estado del arte. AsÌ te puedes referir a
% Èl - JJ
% Antonio - pos eso, es una secciÛn conjunta. a la vez que se explican los mÈtodos se comenta el estado del arte en los mismos. ;)
Traffic detection technologies can be generally classified into two groups: intrusive and non-intrusive.

%Vamos a ver si de una vez por todas dej·is de copiar frases literales
%de "por ahÌ". Esta frase est· sacada de http://www.ugpti.org/research/projects.php?view=123&program=atac
% Intrusive detection technologies are installed on or within the roadway, requiring lane closures. Using this type of technology is inherently more hazardous and is generally more time consuming, especially for temporary traffic data collection. This technology has a number of drawbacks:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Installation requires pavement cut.
%   \item Improper installation decreases pavement life.
%   \item Installation and maintenance require lane closure.
%   \item Detection accuracy may decrease when design requires detection of a large variety of vehicle classes.
%   \item Poor pavement condition can dramatically shorten the life span of intrusive sensors.
% \end{itemize}
% Borro y expresadlo de otra forma. - JJ

% Antonio - Hecho debajo. ;)

Intrusive detection technologies imply a physical modification of the roadway, i.e., they are installed on, and frequently, under the pavement. This is the main disadvantage, since it requires the lanes must be closed for the installation process. Moreover it could affect the road life, requiring usually several posterior maintenance tasks.
These methods also present some accuracy problems due to the difficulty to detect different types of vehicles.
Some examples of intrusive technologies are inductive loop detectors, piezoelectric sensors, or weigh in motion detectors.

% Non-intrusive technologies are traffic detection sensors that cause
% minimal disruption to normal traffic operations during installation,
% operation and maintenance compared to conventional detection
% methods. They can also be deployed more safely than conventional
% detection methods, since they are located adjacent to the roadway
% and require minimal interaction with traffic flow. Non-intrusive
% technologies can be classified in two big groups: active
% technologies (microwave radar, ultrasonic and laser radar), and
% passive technologies (infrared, acoustic and video image
% processing). 
%TambiÈn est· copiado. Por favor, no copiÈis nunca frases ni siquiera
%en versiones iniciales - JJ

On the other hand non-intrusive technologies do not cause traffic interruptions during the installation and maintenance processes, since they are usually placed on the roadway sides, or are installed on traffic or informative signs.
Non-intrusive methods are classified in active and passive technologies. 
Active ones include microwave, ultrasonic and laser radars. Passive methods can be infrared and video image processing or acoustic sensors, among others.

%Figure \ref{tipossensores} shows a classification of sensor-based information systems according to the intrusiveness of the technology.

%\end{figure}

% Antonio - quito la figura porque se han comentado los ejemplos en el texto. ;)

Current technologies most frequently used in traffic monitoring
include pneumatic tubes, loop detectors, floating vehicles, and
automatic recognition systems, among others. Some of them are explained next:
%usad \itemize, jolines... - JJ
% Antonio - hecho. Reescribo adem·s cada punto para que no nos digan n·. ;D

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Manual counting} is a traditional method in which human observers, using a counting tool, perform the data gathering task. They can extract information difficult to obtain with other methods, such as vehicle classification or occupancy.

    \item \emph{Pneumatic road tubes}: are included in the intrusive technologies. They are deployed across the roadway and detect pressure changes when the vehicles pass over them. However, their efficiency depends on the weather conditions and temperature, and are not reliable to recognize low speed traffic flows.

    \item \emph{Piezoelectric sensors}: are another intrusive components which work in a similar way than the previous tubes, but based in the mechanical deformation of the material, which means an electric signal (potential difference) of different intensity is detected. The deformation depends on the vehicle's weight, so these sensors can differentiate some classes of vehicles and measure speed.

    \item \emph{Magnetic loops}: the most common intrusive technology in traffic data gathering. They consist in a set of loops placed under the asphalt generating a magnetic field. When a vehicle moves over this field it can be detected and counted. They can differentiate between vehicles (in some range) depending on the detected iron mass size. They have a shorter life (can be damaged by heavy vehicles) and are quite expensive (installation and maintenance), but are not affected by weather conditions.

    \item \emph{Passive and active infrared sensors}: non-intrusive method which consider the infrared energy which vehicles radiate to detect their presence, speed and even their type. They perform worse in bad weather conditions and have a quite limited covering.

    \item \emph{Microwave radar}: another non-intrusive technology. It is based in the Doppler effect, and can detect vehicles in movement and their speed. The advantage is that it is not affected by weather conditions.

    \item \emph{Ultrasonic sensors}: it is also a non-intrusive technology based in sound. There are some devices that emit ultrasonic sound waves which are detected by the sensors when returning once they have rebounded in a vehicle. They measure the returning time for the signal to calculate the vehicle's speed. Weather conditions and temperature affect their performance. 

\end{itemize}
% 

A different technology consists in the use of the so-called \emph{floating vehicles}, i.e. vehicles provided with sensors and anthems to collect information while driving on a predefined route (active) or from an static, and usually strategic, position (passive).
This active data gathering is one of the most popular among operators of roads, and is especially used for the calculation of travel times and for loop detectors calibration. Depending on the level of automation in the data collection, the cost can vary.

In some areas, such as electronic toll or transit systems, \emph{automatic vehicle identification systems} (AVI) are also widely used. 
These sensors are non-exhaustive data sources to identify tags located in vehicles, such as in payment-systems without stopping. 
The system detects the pass, and the data is sent to the server where it is processed in order to carry out an event (pay toll, opening the fence, etc).

The main disadvantage of all these systems is that they are unable to identify vehicles detected, in order to obtain origin/destination matrixes.
Just the number of vehicles and sometimes their type can be computed, but does not allow to obtain moves flow, nor to determine whether a certain vehicle passes repeatedly.
In addition, its high cost makes it unprofitable covering secondary roads with them, so they are often located on main roadways.

Thus the \emph{automatic recognition} technology has rapidly grown in recent years due to its ability to detect individual vehicles without relying on in-vehicle systems. 
\emph{Video image detection} is an example: video cameras record vehicle numbers, type and speed by means of different video techniques, e.g. trip line and tracking. 
Furthermore, they are used for automatic detection of incidents on the road. 
That is the main advantage over previous information systems.
However, system reliability might not be the best, as the system can be sensitive to meteorological conditions.
Moreover, these systems are very costly compared to the previous ones.
Finally, from a privacy point of view, the Spanish Data Protection Agency\footnote{Agencia de ProtecciÛn de Datos} considers the car license plate as a personal data, so their use could require the user consent.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Commercial products}
There are different companies working in the traffic information area using approaches similar to the presented in this work.

\begin{itemize}

%aunque sean comerciales deberÌais buscar referencias donde se usen. 
\item \textbf{Bit Carrier} \cite{patenteBC} \cite{BitCarrier}: It offers a traffic management system based in BT to count people and commercial routes (pathsolver). Its technology was implanted in highways managed by Abertis for traffic control and monitoring. Actually it has a 150 devices network in Catalonia, so it allows count the traffic times of 200.000 persons each day.
 
\item \textbf{Trafficnow} \cite{Trafficnow}: Another BT system product. A pilot experience has been implanted in Vigo.

 \item \textbf{Traffax Inc} \cite{TraffaxInc}: It is a company that also has used BT for calculating origin-destination and transport time matrixes.

 \item \textbf{Savari Networks} \cite{SavariNetworks}: It offers the commercial product StreetWAVE for traffic monitoring to know in real time the traffic status.


 \item \textbf{TrafficCast} \cite{TrafficCast}: They have developed prediction models in different cities based on different technologies, such as cameras, BT and RFID included in the vehicles.

\end{itemize}

The proposal presented in this work have some common features with the previous approaches, offering similar functionality but with reduced cost.
% Antonio - hay que darle muuucho m·s bombo a lo que se hace en el artÌculo con el mÈtodo que proponemos. Decir sus ventajas (bajo coste, gran capacidad de detecciÛn, etc) y compararlas con los mÈtodos existentes.

%===============================================================================

\subsection{Time series forecasting}
% DeberÌa ir tambiÈn en la introducciÛn, antes del estado del arte. 
\label{subsec:time-series}
Briefly described, a time series is a set of chronologically ordered data. Time series forecasting is the task of predicting values of a given series using its own past and present values; the values of any related exogeneous variable can be also used, when available.
Time series forecasting is a major field of research, mainly in the areas of statistics \cite{De Gooijer and Hyndman, 2006} and operational research \cite{Fildes2008}, as time series can be found in fields like Engineering, Biology, Economy, or Social Sciences, among many others.

Time series forecasting is usually tackled trying to find out an underlying model that describes the series behaviour. For this reason, there exist a wide variety of methods to perform forecast using both linear and nonlinear models. The group of linear methods comprises the exponential smoothing methods \cite{Brown1959,Winters1960}, simple exponential smoothing (SES), or State space models \cite{Snyder1985}, among many others. Nevertheless, the most well-known, widely used linear methods are the ARIMA ones \cite{Box and Jenkins, 1976}. ARIMA methods can be summarized as iterative cycles in which: a) the time series is classified as belonging to a pre-established class; b) according to that class, a set of parameters is estimated; and c) the obtained model is verified in other to accept it, or search for another one returning to first step. The models provide by ARIMA integrate in their equations autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components to have into account pass values as well as previous forecasting errors.

Despite their ease of use, linear models have shown no to be accurate for many real applications, being this the main reason why new (but also more complex and difficult to be used) nonlinear methods have been developed. Nonlinear models include regime-switching models, which comprise the wide variety of existing threshold autoregressive (TAR) models \cite{Tong1978}. Clements \cite{Clements2004} exposed main drawbacks of nonlinear methods, mainly the excessively complex models they provide, the lack of robust performance, and, worst of all, the difficulty to use. De Gooijer \cite{De Gooijer and Hyndman, 2006} also concludes that future research on nonlinear models should include, among others, the search for easy to use software.

%\subsection{Soft computing methods for time series forecasting}

Forecasting values for time series has been also faced with soft computing approaches; for instance, the ones by Samanta \cite{Samanta2011} and Zhu \cite{Zhu2011}, who developed methods based on cooperative particle swarm optimization. In \cite{Qiu2011} and \cite{Wang2011} fuzzy time series models are proposed in order to predict new values.Similarly, Yu and Huarng \cite{Yu2010} applied ANNs for training and forecasting in their fuzzy time series model. Models such as support vector regression \cite{Kavaklioglu2011} and fuzzy expert system \cite{Dash1995} were proposed for the electricity demand forecasting, among others.

As can be seen, ANNs have been applied to time series and they are currently recognized as an important tool for forecasting. 

Tang \cite{Tang1991} concluded that ANNs could provide better long-term forecasting; moreover, ANNs can perform better than ARIMA models with short series of input data. Furthermore, contrary to the traditional linear and nonlinear time series models, ANNs are nonlinear data-driven approaches with more flexibility and effectiveness in modeling for forecasting \cite{Zhang1998b}. Jain and Kumar determined in their work \cite{Jain2007} that the ANN models were able to produce more accurate forecasts than traditional models because they do not presuppose any functional form of the model to be developed and they do not depend on the assumptions of linearity.

There exist numerous works of different application areas where ANNs are used to forecast time series. The work by Arizmendi \cite{Arizmendi1993} obtained accurate predictions of the airborne pollen concentrations using ANNs. Zhang and Hu \cite{Zhang1998b} employed ANNs, and Rivas et al. \cite{Rivas04} RBFNs, for forecasting British pound and US dollar exchange rates. Bezerianos et al. \cite{Bezerianos1999} employed RBFNs for the assessment and prediction of the heart rate variability. 

%\subsection{Radial Basic Function Networks}

Specifically inside the ANNs, the use of RBFs as activation functions for them and its application to time series forecasting were firstly considered by Broomhead and Lowe in 1988 \cite{Broomhead88}. Afterwards, new works by Carse and Fogarty \cite{Carse1996}, and Whitehead and Choate \cite{Whitehead96} focused on the prediction of time series.

In later works, Harpham and Dawson \cite{Harpham06} studied the effect of different basis functions on an RBFN for time series prediction. Moreover, Du \cite{Du2008} used time series with an encoding scheme for training RBFNs by GAs. Both the architecture (numbers and selections of nodes and inputs) and the parameters (centers and widths) of the RBFNs were represented in one chromosome and evolved simultaneously by GAs so that the selection of nodes and inputs could be automatically achieved.

Previous works found in literature can also be classified according to the prediction horizon. Thus, forecasting can be divided into short-term, medium-term, and long-term. Generally, forecasting is trended to short-term prediction such as one-step ahead prediction, since longer period prediction (medium-term or long-term) is more difficult, and sometimes may not be reliant because of the error propagation \cite{Chatterjee06}. Thus, neural network models have been traditionally applied in short-term forecasting \cite{Hippert10,Lee09}. For instance, the work by Perez-Godoy \cite{PerezGodoy2010} applied a hybrid evolutionary cooperative-competitive algorithm for the design of RBFNs to the short-term and even medium-term forecasting of the extra-virgin olive oil price.

%\subsubsection{Lags selection}

As mentioned, another problem that emerges working with time series is the correct choice of the lags considered for representing the series. The relationship involving time series historical data defines a $d$-dimensional space where $d$ is the minimum dimension capable of representing such a relationship. Takens' theorem \cite{Takens1980} establishes that if $d$ is sufficiently large is possible to build a state space using the correct time lags and if this space is correctly rebuilt also guarantees that the dynamics of this space is topologically identical to the dynamics of the real systems state space. %Many methods can be found in the literature for the correct definition of the variable $d$, that is, the correct choice of the important time lags of the system dynamics, sometimes called as active dimension of the dynamics generating a time series from the observed series \cite{Tanaka2001}.

In order to tackle the lags selection problem, an evolutionary method that performs a search for the minimum number of dimensions, Time-delay Added Evolutionary Forecasting (TAEF), is presented in \cite{Ferreira2008}. The methodology is inspired in Takens' theorem [***CITA***] and consists of an iterative hybrid model composed of an ANN combined with a genetic algorithm (GA). In \cite{Luko2010} the evolutionary selection of lags is divided into two stages: first, the optimal dimension of the reconstructed phase space is determined by the false nearest neighbors algorithm and then a near-optimal set of time lags is found with a genetic algorithm for a fuzzy inference system.

%In general, these proposals are based on the primary dependences among the variables, do not consider any possible induced dependences, and discard any possible correlation that can exist among the time series parameters, even higher order correlations.
There are some methods that carry out an automatic search of the relevant lags. QIEHI algorithm \cite{Araujo2010a}, for instance, is an evolutionary hybrid intelligent method which is composed of an ANN and a modified evolutionary algorithm to search the minimum dimension to determine the characteristic phase for time series. %The model is built in two stages as in \cite{Ferreira2008}.
Another hybrid methodology composed of a modular morphological ANN with an evolutionary algorithm that searches for the best time lags is described in \cite{Araujo2010b}. %With the same modular morphological neural network, the time lags are obtained by means of a particle swarm optimizer in \cite{Araujo2010c} and by means of a modified GA in \cite{Araujo2011}.
In \cite{garcia2008} a study on the selection not only of the lags but also of the exogenous features with classical feature selection algorithms as pre-processing stage is performed. %The authors show the utility of a feature selection pre-processing stage for time series forecasting with different models.
The lag selection is performed as a post-processing stage in \cite{Maus2011} with a sensitivity computation of the output to each time lag. %The initial stage trains a single-layer, feed-forward ANN based on $d$ time lags, with $d$ chosen large enough to capture the relevant dynamics of the time series. %Another methodology which considers the lag selection as a post-processing stage is
%TDSEP \cite{Sun2006} uses a GA for the optimal selection of time lags for a previously obtained and diagonalized second-order correlation matrices.

As can be observed, the approaches in the literature consider the lags selection as a pre- or post-processing or as a part of the learning process but, instead of together, in hybrid processes with two or three stages. On the contrary, our goal is to address the selection of the lags which represent the series (with any type of correlation) jointly with the design process.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% DATA COLLECTING %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Procedures used for data collection}
\label{sec:data}

Identifying the MAC address of BT devices passing by the roads has
being achieved using the Intelify device (see Figure \ref{intelify}), a hardware solution with a low power consumption and a high detection range.

\begin{figure}[htpb] 
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{intelifychisme1.png}
\end{center} 
\caption{Intelify device with a connected USB 3G dongle.} 
\label{intelify} 
\end{figure}

Intelify is a small autonomous computer that can be installed in any area to be monitored. It is an autonomous unit, provided by several sensors so that it can discover what is happening in its surroundings (like the flow of people and vehicles).

This hardware device is based on technology developed by Ciudad 2020 \cite{cityanalytics,Blobject}, and the services it offers are based on a net of Intelify devices. Using such an structure, it has the capacity to discover information about the physical environment and help with decision making to any kind of organization based on people flow and behavior.

Valuable information about tourism, trade and mobility can be gathered
through the deployment of autonomous devices around a city. A specific
example is the service offered in \cite{numerodepersonas}. It offers
information about foot traffic through Cordoba city center. % Esta

The cost of this solution is 1000 euros per device, including maintenance of remote computer, communications using a 3G telephony service and storage and data management.

Data accuracy is very representative, compared against other technologies.
In \cite{estudioprecision} it was obtained an a priori error estimation of $8.5\%$ of detections.
%This study \cite{estudioprecision} shows that the average error found in the detection of people is 8.5\%.


??????Descripci√≥n de los datos recopilados
For this work, the data collected by 5 nodes during 60 days has been
used. First day corresponds to November 24, 2011, while last day
corresponds to January 22, 2013. Figure \ref{fig:collected-data} shows
the ammount of BT devices detected by each node along this
period. Nodes 4 and 5 are shown in a separate graphics since they were
located in a highway, so that they registered a higher number of BT
devices. % Se va a liberar ese dato? ConvendrÌa hacerlo (tambiÈn por

????? TODO ESTO HAY QUE CAMBIARLO PARA LOS DATOS REALES CON LSO QUE AL FINAL HEMOS TRABAJADO

In this section the analysis of collected data during the monitoring period (November 8 to December 9) to obtain statistics and so study the use of vehicles is carried out.

 % Concretamente, en las siguientes subsecciones, reportaremos
 % informaci√≥n acerca del n√∫mero total de veh√≠culos detectados por
 % cada nodo, en d√≠as laborables o festivos, sobre la densidad del
 % tr√°fico por rango horario, acerca de los desplazamientos

 % dos nodos consecutivos. 
Specifically, the following subsections report information about the
total number of vehicles detected by each node, on weekdays or
holidays, information on traffic density by time range on individual
movements, and the average speed on a section delimited by two
consecutive nodes.

 % Por √∫ltimo, puesto que el d√≠a 14 de noviembre de 2012 se celebr√≥ la huelga general, estudiaremos c√≥mo afect√≥ la huelga al tr√°fico en el √°rea metropolitana de Granada, comparando los totales de detecci√≥n de dispositivos entre el d√≠a de la huelga (14 de noviembre), y el mi√©rcoles siguiente (21 de noviembre).
Finally, since November 14 2012 a general strike was held, we will study how the strike affected traffic in the metropolitan area of Granada (Spain), by comparing total number of devices detected that day (November 14), and the following day (November 15).

%===============================================================================

\subsection{Total number of vehicles detected (weekdays and holidays)}
 % VehiculosTotales.txt tiene los veh√≠culos totales detectados en cada nodo.

% La primera parte del an√°lisis ha consistido en calcular el n√∫mero de dispositivos detectados por cada uno de los nodos instalados.
The first analysis consisted in calculating the number of devices detected by each node.

 \label{VehiculosTotales}}
 \end{table}

 % En total se han detectado 773845 dispositivos BT al paso por los seis nodos. 
 % Como se observa en la Tabla \ref{VehiculosTotales}, los dos nodos situados en la autov√≠a de Sierra Nevada (A44, Circunvalaci√≥n de Granada, nodos 4 y 5) son los que m√°s datos han recogido, mientras que el situado en una calle secundaria (nodo 6) ha sido el que menos dispositivos ha recogido.

In total, 773,845 BT devices have been detected by the six nodes.
As shown in Table \ref{VehiculosTotales}, nodes located in the Sierra Nevada Highway (A44, nodes 4 and 5) have collected a higher number of data, while the node located in a side street (node 6) has detected the smallest number of devices.

%===============================================================================

\subsection{Total vehicles detected on non-working days}
 % VehiculosFestivos.txt tiene los veh√≠culos detectados en d√≠a festivo en cada nodo.

 % A continuaci√≥n, y para comparar la intensidad circulatoria entre d√≠as laborables y no laborables, se ha calculado el n√∫mero de pasos en d√≠as festivos y no laborables.
To compare the traffic intensity between working and non-working days, the number of pass on holidays and non-working days have been obtained.

 % La Tabla \ref{VehiculosFestivos} muestra un descenso en el n√∫mero de dispositivos detectados por todos los nodos en d√≠as no laborables, frente al n√∫mero de detecciones en d√≠as laborables. 
 % A√∫n as√≠, los nodos situados en la autov√≠a de Sierra Nevada siguen recogiendo muchos m√°s datos que el resto, debido al tr√°fico denso que soporta esta v√≠a en d√≠as no laborables.

Table \ref{VehiculosFestivos} shows how the number of detected devices lowers by all nodes on non-working days, compared to the number of detections on weekdays.
Nodes located in the Sierra Nevada Highway still collected much more data than the remainder, due to the traffic this road supports on holidays.

%===============================================================================

\subsection{Traffic density on the road by time range}
 % VehiculosDiferentesPorHoras.txt contiene para cada uno de los nodos, los dispositivos diferentes detectados en cada rango horario (final de la l√≠nea)

 % La densidad circulatoria por horas podemos calcularla a partir del total de dispositivos diferentes detectados en cada rango horario.
Traffic density can be calculated taking into account the total number of detected devices by time range.

 % La Figura \ref{VehiculosDiferentesPorHoras} muestra mayor densidad, en todos los nodos, a las horas punta de entrada o salida del trabajo y colegios.
Figure \ref{VehiculosDiferentesPorHoras} shows higher density on all nodes, at peak times or out of work and school.

%===============================================================================

\subsection{Total detections by time range}
 % VehiculosPorHoras.txt indica para cada nodo, el n√∫mero de dispositivos detectados en el rango horario, sin diferenciar si el dispositivo es siempre el mismo o no. 

 % Adicionalmente podemos calcular para cada nodo, el n√∫mero de dispositivos detectados en cada rango de horas, sin diferenciar si el dispositivo es siempre el mismo o no. As√≠ pues, se incluir√°n pasos repetidos del mismo veh√≠culo.
Additionally we can calculate for each node, the number of detected devices by time range, without differentiating whether the device is the same or not (repeated passes). Thus, repeated passes of the same vehicle are counted.

 % Al igual que en el caso anterior, observamos una mayor densidad circulatoria en todos los nodos, a las horas punta de entrada o salida del trabajo y colegios (ver la Figura \ref{VehiculosPorHoras}).
As in the previous case, a greater traffic density can be observed on all nodes, at peak times or out of work and school. (see Figure \ref{VehiculosPorHoras}).

\subsection{Number of individual vehicles detections}
 % Intervalos.txt contine el n√∫mero de veh√≠culos detectados entre 0 y 5 veces, entre 5 y 10 veces y as√≠ sucesivamente hasta m√°s de 25 veces detallado en cada nodo.

 % A continuaci√≥n podemos sacar partido de la capacidad del sistema propuesto para individualizar los dispositivos BT, pudiendo detectar si esos mismos veh√≠culos repiten paso por diferentes nodos.
We can take advantage of the proposed system's ability to identify BT devices. Thus, it can be detected whether vehicles pass by different nodes.

 \begin{figure}[htb]

 % En la Figura \ref{Intervalos} podemos ver que hay una gran cantidad de veh√≠culos que repiten su paso por ciertos nodos (principalmente los situados en la A44) hasta 10 veces. 
 % Incluso se puede ver que en los nodos 4 y 5 hay alrededor de 1000 veh√≠culos que repiten su paso m√°s de 25 veces. En el resto de nodos, m√°s de 25 repeticiones del mismo dispositivo se han detectado alrededor de 120 veces solamente.

Figure \ref{Intervalos} shows a large number of vehicles that pass repeated times (up to 10 times) by some of the nodes (mainly those located in the A44).
Even it can be seen that nodes 4 and 5 detect about 1,000 vehicles passing more than 25 times repeated. 
On the other nodes, over 25 repetitions of the same device have been detected only around 120 times.

\subsection{Complexity of displacement}
 % NodosPorDondePasan.txt contiene el n√∫mero de veh√≠culos que han pasado por 2 nodos, por 3 nodos y as√≠ hasta por los 6 nodos y el n√∫mero medio de veces que han pasado 2, 3, 4, 5 o 6 veces por cada nodo.

 % En el estudio de la complejidad de los desplazamientos se han calculado el n√∫mero de veh√≠culos que han pasado por 2 nodos, por 3 nodos y hasta 6 nodos. En la Tabla \ref{tNodosPorDondePasan} se muestra adem√°s el n√∫mero medio de veces que han pasado un veh√≠culo por 2, 3, 4, 5 o 6 nodos.
To study the complexity of displacements, the number of vehicles that have passed through two nodes, 3 nodes and up to 6 nodes  were calculated. 
Table 4 also shows the average number of times that vehicles have passed through 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 nodes.

 % Histograma que muestre cu√°ntos coches pasan s√≥lo por un nodo, por dos nodos, por tres nodos, etc.

 % Como se esperaba, gran parte de los dispositivos BT pasan pocas veces por casi todos los nodos, mientras que la mayor√≠a pasa s√≥lo por uno o dos de ellos (sus desplazamientos se centran en una parte de la zona peque√±a monitorizada).
As expected, most of the BT devices rarely passed by all nodes, while most of devices pass only by one or two of nodes (their displacements are focused on a small part of the monitored area).

 % Justo en mitad del periodo de monitorizaci√≥n, en Espa√±a se celebr√≥ un d√≠a de huelga general (14 de noviembre de 2012), lo que ha quedado reflejado en la cantidad de coches detectados en los nodos.

 % Se ha analizado el efecto de la huelga general en el tr√°fico de la zona monitorizada, mostrando en la Tabla \ref{huelga} el n√∫mero de pasos detectados el d√≠a 14 de noviembre y justo el d√≠a siguiente.

Right in the middle of the monitoring period in Spain was held a day of general strike (November 14, 2012), which has been reflected in the number of detected devices (cars) on the nodes.

 % Por √∫ltimo, a partir de los dos nodos consecutivos localizados en la autov√≠a A44, podemos calcular velocidades medias en el tramo delimitado por los nodos 4 (situado en el km 119,550) y 5 (situado en el km 123,250) de un total de 3700 metros. 
 % En realidad podemos calcular la velocidad media en el tramo a nivel global, no la velocidad a la que ha ido cada veh√≠culo en cada instante dentro del tramo.

Finally, taking two consecutive nodes, located on the A44 highway, average speeds in the section bounded by nodes 4 (located at km 119.550) and 5 (located at km 123.250) can be calculated.
This highway section where the study takes place is of 3700 meters long.
Actually, we can calculate the average speed in the global section, not the speed at which each vehicle has at each instant within the section.

\subsection{Flow traffic prediction by means of time-series forecasting}
As far as data is chronologically collected, methods coming from the area of time-series forecasting can be used in order to predict future behaviour of traffic flow.

From the big variety of existing mtethods, 6 different ones have been selected in order to compare the validity of their predictions. The methods being used are: ARIMA, Croston, Theta, Spline,L-Co-R, and as control algorithm, the mean value. Methods  ARIMA, Croston, Theta, Spline and Mean have been executed using the R software, by means of the Forecast package (???cita). In the other hand, L-Co-R is a co-evolutionary algorithm of our own, based on radial basis function neural networks. In order to compare the methods, a statistical study is included allowing us to draw some conclusions.

The experimentation has been carried out using the data collected for five nodes over 60 days (from 24/November/2012 to 22/January/2013). The first 53 days have been used to train the methods, and obtain their associated models, and the remaining 7 days have been used to test their generalization capabilities. The prediction of these 7-days test has been made for an horizon of 1, so that known data until day $n$ have been used to forecast day $n+1$. 

For each method and each node, a set of measures have been computed in order to determine the accuracy of the prediction. As most textbooks recommend, one of the chosen measures is  the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) \cite{Bowerman2004}, which was used in the first M-competition \cite{Makridakis1982}. Median Absolute Percentage Error (MdAPE) \cite{Armstrong,Fildes1992} is also used, as a normalized version of the previous one. More recently, the description of many others measures can be found in  \cite{De Gooijer and Hyndman, 2006} and \cite{Hyndman2006}. Among all of them, in this work we use the followings:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MAE}
            MAE = mean(\mid e_t\mid)
        \end{equation}

  \item Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MAPE}
            MAPE = mean(\mid p_t\mid)
        \end{equation}

        \bigskip
  \item Median Absolute Percentage Error (MdAPE):
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MDAPE}
            MdAPE = median(\mid p_t\mid)
        \end{equation}

  \item Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE):
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MASE}
            MASE = mean(\mid q_t\mid)
        \end{equation}

  \item Mean Squared Error (MSE):
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MSE}
            MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n {e_t}^2
        \end{equation}

%  \item Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
%        \begin{equation}\label{eq:RMSE}
%            RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n {e_t}^2}
%        \end{equation}


where $Y_t$ is the observation at time $t = {1,...,n}$; $F_t$ is the forecast of $Y_t$; $e_t$ is the forecast error (i.e. $e_t= Y_t - F_t$); $p_t = 100e_t/Y_t$ is the percentage error, and

Given the stochastic nature of evolutionary algorithms, and in order to remove biases due to random generator, L-Co-R has been running 30 times per node. Thus, the error attached to this algorithm correspond to the average error values of these 30 executions.

Table \ref{tb:ts-results} show the different error values for every method and node. Boldfaces highlight  the lowest (best) values per algorithm, node and measure. As table shows, best algorithms tends to be L-Co-R and ARIMA, since L-Co-R obtains the lowest results for measures MAE, MAPE, MdAPE and MASE (except for node 2), but there is not a clear winner in MSE and SMAPE.

 \caption{Values for the six error measures (MAE, MAPE, MASE, MdAPE, MSE, and SMAPE) yielded for any of the six methods (ARIMA, Croston, Theta, Spline, Mean and L-Co-R) when forecasting time series of nodes 1 to 5. Boldfaces stress best (lowest) values.
 \label{tb:ts-results}}
 \end{table}

The results yielded by every method have been compared using two non-parametric test: the Friedman test and the Iman-Davenport test. Using this two test, we are able to determine whether there exist significant differences between the methods or not, and we can establish a ranking of methods according to their ability to perform forecast. These test have been carried out using ??? SOFTRWAE DE SALVA. Both, Friedman and Iman-Davenport tests, reveal that results can be considered significantly differents when the computed \emph{P-value} is less than $0.05$. Table \ref{tb:friedman-iman-tests} shows that any of the \emph{P-value} computed by the tests are under $0.05$, and this occurs in any of the six error measures being considered.



\begin{table} \footnotesize
 \begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\emph{Error} & \emph{Friedman P-value} & \emph{Iman-Davenport P-value} \\
\hline
\emph{MAE} & $0.0052$ & $0.0003$ \\
\emph{MAPE} & $0.0080$ & $0.0008$ \\
\emph{MASE} & $0.0141$ & $0.0030$ \\
\emph{MdAPE} & $0.0063$ & $0.0005$ \\
\emph{MSE} & $0.0213$ & $0.0066$ \\
\emph{SMAPE} & $0.0440$ & $0.0233$ \\
\hline

 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
 \caption{\emph{P-value} yielded by Friedman and Iman-Davenport non-parametrics tests for every error measure. A \emph{P-value} lower than $0.05$ (all of them in this case) indicates that there exist significant differences between the errors computed for every method.
 \label{tb:friedman-iman-tests}}
 \end{table}

Futhermore, Friedman test results also provide a mechanism to establish a ranking between the methods, determining which one can be considered the best. Once the method has been found out, it can be compared against the rest methods using the Holm's procedure (ø???CITA). This method computes the probability that two methods can be considered to have a similar behaviour, being this the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is rejected when this probabilhttp://www.restaurantelaplatea.com/menu-celebraciones/ity is lower than $0.05$, so that methods can be considered to be significantly differents. Holm's procedure has been applied to any of the six error measure being considered. Table \ref{tb:holm-all} summarizes the rankings of methods, as well as the existence or absence of significant differences. Thus, this statistic study shows that L-Co-R is the best algorithm in four of six error measures (MAE, MAPE, MASE, and MdAPE); nevertheless, it can not be said to be better than ARIMA in any case but, for most measures, it overcomes the rest of methods.
