In this paper, we propose a {FGPGA} method based on {GPU-acceleration,} which maps parallel {GA} algorithm to texture-rendering on consumer-level graphics cards. The analytical results demonstrate that the proposed method increases the population size, speeds up its execution and provides ordinary users with a feasible {FGPGA} solution.},    booktitle = {Network and Parallel Computing Workshops, 2007. {NPC} Workshops. {IFIP} International Conference on},    author = {{Jian-Ming} Li and {Xiao-Jing} Wang and {Rong-Sheng} He and {Zhong-Xian} Chi},    year = {2007},    keywords = {consumer-level graphics cards, data communication, efficient fine-grained parallel genetic algorithm, genetic algorithms, {GPU-acceleration,} optimization problems, parallel computers, rendering (computer graphics), texture-rendering},    pages = {855--862}    }    @incollection {Zhang2009,   author = {Zhang, Sifa and He, Zhenming},   title = {Implementation of Parallel Genetic Algorithm Based on CUDA},   booktitle = {Advances in Computation and Intelligence},   series = {Lecture Notes in Computer Science},   editor = {Z.
