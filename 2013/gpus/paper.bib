In these methods, designing neighborhood operators to explore large promising regions of the search space may improve the quality of the obtained solutions at the expense of a high computation process. As a consequence, the use of GPU computing provides an efficient way to speed up the search. However, designing applications on GPU is still complex and many issues have to be faced. We provide a methodology to design and implement different neighborhood structures for LS algorithms on GPU. The work has been evaluated for binary problems and the obtained results are convincing both in terms of efficiency, quality and robustness of the provided solutions at run time.}},

The QAP is a classical combinatorial optimisation problem that is difficult to solve optimally for even small problems with over 30 items. By using graphic hardware acceleration, the developed SIMD-TS algorithm executes 20 to 45 times faster than traditional CPU code. The computational improvement is made possible by the utilisation of the parallel computing capability of a graphics processing unit (GPU). The speed and effectiveness of this algorithm are demonstrated on QAP library problems. The main contribution of this paper is a fast and effective SIMD-TS algorithm capable of producing results for large QAPs on a desktop personal computer equivalent to the results achieved with a CPU cluster.",

In TS for QAP, all neighbor moves are tested. These moves form two groups based on computing of move cost. In one group, the computing of cost is O(1) and in the other group, the computing of move cost is O(n). We compute these two groups of moves in parallel by assigning the computations to threads of CUDA. In this assignment, we propose an efficient method which we call Move-Cost Adjusted Thread Assignment (MATA). The results with GPU computation with MATA show a promising speedup compared to computation with the CPU. It is also shown that MATA is effective in applying 2-opt local search.},

Using three well-known benchmark problems and one real-life problem, we discuss the role of the parameters that characterize the evolutionary process of standard panmictic and parallel genetic programming. We find that distributing individuals between subpopulations offers in all cases studied here an advantage both in terms of the quality of solutions and of the computational effort spent, when compared to single populations. We also study the influence of communication patterns such as the communication topology, the number of individuals exchanged and the frequency of exchange on the evolutionary process. We empirically show that the topology does not have a marked influence on the results for the test cases studied here, while the frequency and number of individuals exchanged are related and there exists a suitable range for those parameters which is consistently similar for all the problems studied.},

After evaluating such a dEDA on several well-known discrete and continuous test problems, we conclude that our model clearly outperforms existing centralized approaches from a numerical point of view, as well as speeding up the search considerably, thanks to its suitability for physical parallelism.},
