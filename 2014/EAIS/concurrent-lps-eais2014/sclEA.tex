We developed a library in Scala following the same design concepts and it was tested with the case study. The code is open, under AGPL license, at\url{https://github.com/jalbertcruz/sclEA/archive/v1.0.tar.gz}. The main classes and objects are briefly described.

\subsubsection{Evaluator/Reproducer's classes}

The reproducer class select the subpopulation and parents for reproduction, it does the crossover and activate migrations. As actor respond to {\em evolve} and {\em emigrateBest} messages, for iteration and migration operations.

Class {\em Evaluator} consults the pool constantly looking for no-evaluated individuals. It is compound by the function {\em evaluate/1} (general evaluation function), and the message: {\em evaluate} for fire the calculation.

These two kinds of actors are the execution units working to reach the solutions. They have, concerning architecture, the same role as Erlangâ€™s actors, with the same behavior but in an object oriented way.
