We developed a library in Clojure following the same design concepts and it was tested with the study case. The code is open, under AGPL license, at \url{https://github.com/jalbertcruz/cljEA/archive/v1.0.tar.gz}. This implementation uses the same naming and architectural conventions as in Erlang and Scala.
