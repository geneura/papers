The Clojure’s main concurrent used concepts are \textbf{agent}, \textbf{ref} and \textbf{atom}; the functional ones are \textbf{function} and \textbf{list}. Clojure is a language with a very strict control of state changes; it demands a clear identification of the code doing it % Haciendo qué?
 and that is similar to Erlang where the functional purity is pursued too.

Agents were the concept used for implementing the independent units of execution (reproductors, evaluators, and islands). The communication between agents was made by protocol’s functions due to the needed flexibility. GA’s operations, their logic and constraints, were expressed in functions and protocol implementations and the data was encoded in lists and vectors data structures.
