The field of programming languages research is very active in the Computer Science discipline. To find software construction tools with new and better means of algorithms expression is welcome. In the last few years the functional and concurrent paradigms have produced a rich mix in which concepts of the first one had been simplified by the use of the second ones.

Among this new generation, the languages Erlang and Scala have embraced the actor model of concurrency and get excelentes results in many application domains; Clojure is another one with concurrent features such as promises/futures, Software Transaction Memory and agents. All of these tools have processes like built-in types and scale beyond the restrictions of the number of OS-threads.
