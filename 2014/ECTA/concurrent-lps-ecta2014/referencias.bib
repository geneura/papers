  abstract = {This paper performs an unprecedented comparative study of Metaheuristic
	Optimization Frameworks. As criteria for comparison a set of 271
	features grouped in 30 characteristics and 6 areas has been selected.
	These features include the different metaheuristic techniques covered,
	mechanisms for solution encoding, constraint handling, neighborhood
	specification, hybridization, parallel and distributed computation,
	software engineering best practices, documentation and user interface,
	etc. A metric has been defined for each feature so that the scores
	obtained by a framework are averaged within each group of features;
	leading to a final average score for each framework. Out of thirty
	three frameworks ten have been selected from the literature using
	well-defined filtering criteria, and the results of the comparison
	are analyzed with the aim of identifying improvement areas and gaps
	in specific frameworks and the whole set. Generally speaking, a significant
	lack of support has been found for hyper-heuristics, and par- allel
	and distributed computing capabilities. It is also desirable to have
	a wider implementation of some Software Engineering best practices.
	Finally, a wider sup- port for some metaheuristics and hybridization
	capabilities is needed.},
