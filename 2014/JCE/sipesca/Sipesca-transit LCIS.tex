\begin{abstract}
Current information systems used for data collection and to generate information on the state of the roads
have two drawbacks: the first is that they have no ability to identify and target detected vehicles. The
second is their high cost, which makes them expensive to cover the secondary road network, so they are
usually located just on main routes. Thus, a new low-cost information system to monitor the traffic in
real-time is proposed. This system is based on scanning Bluetooth and Wifi devices that are near the detection
node. A large amount of data from devices by different nodes (movements or
displacements) have been collected. From this data, the frequency of appearance, average speed, or the
number of devices that pass a certain site each day (on both working or non-working days) can be
determined. The analysis of collected data will serve to give statistics and indicators about the use of vehicles by
the population of the monitored area. The overall architechture and involved technologies for the implementation of the entire system is presented here as well as some successfully gathered data.

\section{Introduction}
\PARstart{N}{owadays}, having a system of information on traffic conditions and the use of roads is very important, not only to obtain information about traffic density, but also about repetitions of passing vehicles. This kind of information about traffic flows that occur in a certain area could allow people to optimally manage their motion decisions.

Current technologies used in traffic monitoring include pneumatic tubes, loop detectors, floating vehicles or automatic recognition systems, among others. The main disadvantage of these systems is that they are unable to identify detected vehicles, in order to obtain origin/destination matrices. Just the number of vehicles and their type can be obtained, but they do not allow to obtain traffic flow, nor to determine whether a certain vehicle passes repeatedly. In addition, their high cost makes it unprofitable covering secondary roads with them, so they are often located on major roads. Moreover, technologies based on video image detection are very costly compared to the previous and can be sensitive to meteorological conditions.

In this work, several individualized transit indicators are studied using a new low-cost system information, with a fast deployment and highly reliable. This system provides real-time information about the traffic status on different road types and in real time (available as web services), not only to the official organisms and agencies in charge of the traffic controlling, but also to any person who requests it.

Our aim is having information about traffic using a new system based on the Bluetooth (BT) and Wifi detection devices using several collecting nodes. Thus, we are able to monitor the traffic density and car journeys, identifying the vehicles when they move from one node to another inside the monitored zone. Therefore, various needs have been found:

As stated, the proposed system is based on BT and Wifi device discovery. Specifically, it detects waves emitted by different technological components incorporated on vehicles (hands-free phone sets, GPS) or accessories that the users incorporate to their vehicles, as well as their mobile phones. Although not all vehicles carry a BT transmitter, nowadays increasingly more and more vehicles are equipped with them. In addition, in a very high percentage of vehicles the driver might carry a mobile with BT or Wifi enabled. In any case, as stated in \cite{Blobject} an a priori error estimation of 8.5\% of detections was obtained.

The system collects the MAC address of the device as well as the exact time at which it has been detected. The MAC is a unique identifier for each device, allowing us to identify passing vehicles. Additionally, analysing the MAC in the case of BT devices allows us to determine the manufacturer and even distinguish what type of device it is (i.e. hands-free, PC, mobile phone, etc), as detailed in \cite{IEEEBT} and \cite{wikiOUI}.

From the point of view of data privacy, it is noteworthy that the data collected cannot be associated, at least without recurring to other methods, to any vehicle since there is no information collected that enables the association of the information we collect with a specific person. Unidirectional encryption technology is used, using non standard characters that preclude identifying the MAC of the wireless device.

The proposed system is part of a future prediction system that helps to make decisions, and able to apply knowledge in applications related to mobility. It is expected that the development and deployment of these systems will offer a set of information services with added value that are not achieved with current technologies.

The rest of the chapter is organized as follows: section \ref{sec:tech} reviews current technologies to monitor the traffic that passes through a certain area, section \ref{sec:products} explores some other similar commercial products. Section \ref{sec:objectives} details the goals and expected results. In section \ref{subsec:devices}, the Intelify device is presented. In section \ref{sec:data} typical data gathered by the system are shown. Finally, we present some conclusions and future work. 

\section{Current technologies}
\label{sec:tech}
Several technologies are used to data collection and generation of information on the state of the roads and traffic monitoring. Those systems can be classified according to the immediacy of data, completeness in the collection and intrusiveness \cite{martin2003detector}.

According to the immediacy of data collection, systems are classified into direct data collection (the source obtains data experimentally), and indirect data collection (the data is obtained by further processing algorithms).

Taking into account the completeness of data collection, systems can be making nearly exhaustive (the number of measurements taken match the number of users), or non-exhaustive data collection (measurements related to a limited number of users are taken).

Finally, current monitoring technologies can be classified as intrusive technologies (installed in the pavement), not-intrusive technologies (no contact with the road, causing minimal effect on traffic flow), and floating vehicle technologies.

Main technologies currently used in traffic monitoring include pneumatic tubes, loop detectors, floating vehicles or automatic recognition systems, among others \cite{rodrigue2013geography}.

Pneumatic tubes are placed on top of the lane to detect vehicles by the change in pressure generated when a vehicle passes over the tube. A device at the roadside counts vehicles. The main drawback is that its efficiency is subject to weather, temperature and traffic conditions.

A loop detector is a wire embedded into the roadway in a square configuration. A device at the roadside records the number of detected vehicles as they induce an electrical current when passing over the wire. Both the implementation and maintenance costs can be expensive.

The use of so-called floating vehicles consists of a vehicle provided with sensors to collect information while driving on a predefined route. This active device data collection is one of the most popular among operators of roads, used especially for the collection of travel time and for loop detector calibration. Depending on the level of automation in the data collection, the cost can vary.

The main disadvantage of these systems is that they are unable to identify detected vehicles, in order to obtain origin/destination matrixes. Just the number of vehicles and their type can be calculated, but does not allow to obtain traffic flow, nor to determine whether a certain vehicle passes repeatedly. In addition, their high cost makes it unprofitable covering secondary roads with them, so they are often located on major roads.

Finally, the automatic recognition technology has experienced an increase in recent years due to its ability to detect individual vehicles without relying on in-vehicle systems. Video image detection is a good example; in this case a trip line and/or tracking are used to record traffic data. Furthermore, they are used for automatic detection of incidents on the road. That is the main advantage over previous information systems. However, system reliability might not be the best, as weather may limit accuracy. Moreover, these systems are very costly compared to the previous \cite{skszek2001state}. Finally, from a privacy point of view, the Spanish Data Protection Agency (Agencia de Protección de Datos) considers the car license plate as a personal data, so that it would require the user consent.

\section{Comercial products}
\label{sec:products}
There are different companies working in the traffic information area using approaches similar to the presented in this work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bit Carrier \cite{mendez2011system,BitCarrier}: It offers a traffic management system based in BT to count people and commercial routes (pathsolver). Its technology was deployed in highways managed by Abertis for traffic control and monitoring. Actually it has a 150 devices network in Catalonia, so it allows count the traffic times of 200.000 persons each day.
\item Trafficnow \cite{Trafficnow}: Another BT system product. A pilot experience has been deployed in Vigo.
\item Traffax Inc \cite{TraffaxInc}: It is a company that also has used BT for calculating origin-destination and transport time matrixes.
\item Savari Networks \cite{SavariNetworks}: It offers the commercial product StreetWAVE for traffic monitoring to know in real time the traffic status.
\item TrafficCast \cite{TrafficCast}: They have developed prediction models in different cities based on different technologies, such as cameras, BT and RFID included in the vehicles.
\end{itemize}
The proposal presented in this work has some common features with the previous approaches, offering similar functionalities with reduced cost.


\section{Objectives and expected results}
\label{sec:objectives}
The main objective was building a low-cost embedded system to provide real-time information about the traffic status and flows that occur in a certain area, allowing to optimally manage motion decisions by citizens.

Thus, several features have been developed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data collection component: it includes several sensors to continuously scanning and identifying BT and Wifi devices. It uses a 3G connection to send data to the storage server. It is enclosed in hermetic boxes and uses a 220V power line.
\item Data processing component: it stores the obtained data, and offers some tools to serve them (through web services).
\item Information service: it provides the users the requested information related to the traffic status.
\end{itemize}

In this study, 13 nodes were installed in Sevilla for data collection. The nodes continuously send data to servers for further processing. Their locations are shown in the map on Figure \ref{fig:f2}. Locations were set according to the suggestions of the National Department of Traffic (DGT), looking for an adequate place, with a continuous flow of vehicles, and also taking into account the assembly difficulty of the monitoring devices (Figure \ref{fig:cabinet} shows the chosen device installed on a cabinet).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/map-sevilla}
\caption{Geographical node locations in the metropolitan area of Sevilla.}
\label{fig:f2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/cabinet}
\caption{Typical device installed on a cabinet.}
\label{fig:cabinet}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


A large amount of data corresponding to passing Wifi and BT devices are collected, to populate a big database and to compute different statistics and indicators on the use of vehicles on the monitored area, driving habits and even the effect of important factors or events (key dates, nonworking days, etc).


Specifically, following statistics will be reported:
\begin{itemize}
\item Total amount of detected devices for every node.
\item Total amount of detected devices in working days.
\item Total amount of detected devices in non-working days.
\item Number of times each device is detected.
\item Type of path the vehicles follow.
\item Traffic density by time range and road type.
\item Average speed in the road where two devices where set.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data-collecting hardware device}
\label{subsec:devices}
The first step of this study was to choose between several hardware devices to scan for BT and Wifi devices. First tests were conducted on a PC with Linux and a BT module. This solution was quickly discarded because of its high size and power consumption (see Table \ref{table:comparison}).

Another possible solution studied was using Android cell phones. These are low power consumption devices, with high connectivity, highly available development tools and powerful processors.

A prototype application was developed for Android. The application was limited to three tasks: BT device discovery, BT identification and data sending to a server through its 3G connection. The server finally stored that information in a database. The Android application binaries can be downloaded from our server \footnote{\scriptsize{\url{http://sipesca.ugr.es/download/descargas/sipesca_bt.apk}}} and its source code is publicly available from GitHub \footnote{\scriptsize{\url{http://github.com/sipesca/appmovilbt}}}.

Despite the advantages of the cell phone, they include small and low power BT antennas. Because of that, their detection capability is very limited; thus, using cell phones was discarded.

Finally the Intelify \cite{Intelify} (see Figure \ref{fig:f3}) was chosen due to its low power consumption and high detection range.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{images/Figure_3}
\caption{Intelify device with a connected USB 3G dongle.}
\label{fig:f3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


Intelify is a hardware detection device developed by \emph{Ciudad 2020} \cite{CityAnalytics,Ciudad2020} . It is an autonomous unit that scan the environment and sends the information to a central server for further processing and interpretation. Table \ref{table:features} shows the main features of this device.

\end{table}

For the sake of comparison, Table \ref{table:comparison} shows detailed information about the hardware devices analyzed for data collecting in terms of size and power consumption. The Raspberry-Pi-based platform \cite{wikiRBP} was chosen for the monitoring devices installed on Sevilla given its power and low-consumption features.

\end{table}


Intelify is a small autonomous computer that can be installed in any area to be monitored. It has several sensors that let you discover what is happening in its surroundings like the flow of people and vehicles.

Device operation is based on scanning devices that are in the area of the BT antenna range using the hcitool operating system tool. This tool is used to configure BT connections and send special commands to BT devices. For example, to discover the BT-enabled devices within range, we can use the scan command:
hcitool scan
hcitool will display the list of MAC addresses of the discovered devices.

Technology was developed by Ciudad 2020 and the services offered are based on a net of monitoring devices with the capacity to discover information about the physical environment and help with decision making to any kind of organization based on people flow and behavior. Valuable information about tourism, trade and mobility can be gathered through the deployment of these autonomous devices around a city. 


The cost of this solution is under \$1000 per device, including remote maintenance, communications using a 3G service, storage and data management.
Data accuracy is very representative, as stated previously, having obtained an a priori error estimation of 8.5\% of detections \cite{Blobject}.

\subsection{Sharing data and information using web services}

To allow the integration with other systems, the Service Oriented Paradigm \cite{papazoglou2007service,garcia2010distributed} has been used. This paradigm allows the usage of available service interfaces (usually over Internet) to access to required information. 

These interfaces allow the \emph{service consumers} to interact \emph{service implementations} with independence of the programming language or operating systems \cite{arsanjani2008soma,castillo2012distributed}. Implementations can be changed and updated, allowing the interoperability and integration with other systems.

Whatever the technology used to deploy web services, they provide several advantages, like language independence and distribution mechanisms; it also increases the interoperability between different software elements (for example, it is possible to add communication libraries without modifying existing code), and facilitates code distribution (it is not required the use of a concrete implementation or library) among geographically distributed work teams \cite{castillo2013using}.

In this case, our platform uses Representational State Transfer (REST) web services \cite{fielding2000architectural}\cite{fielding2002principled}\cite{Vinoski200884}, as this paradigm adheres much more closely to a web-based design. REST is an alternative method for building web services. This technology was proposed and defined by Roy Fielding  \cite{fielding2000architectural}\cite{fielding2002principled}. In a REST-style architecture, a client sends requests to the server who process them and return responses to the client. Requests and responses represent resources that can be addressed by an Uniform resource identifier (URI). Usually, resources are documents or programs the client need to access.

REST web services are simple and lightweight (as no extra XML markup is needed), their message format is readable by humans, they are easy to build, and finally, developments achieve a high performance \cite{daigneau2011service}.


\subsection{Data services implementation}

Developed data services have been designed to extract/insert information in the database taking into account security and availability requirements. Among the different web-centered data management systems Google web services, specifically Google Fusion Tables \cite{gonzalez2010google}\cite{gonzalez2010socializing} was chosen to serve information to end users.  

Google Fusiont Tables is built on two layers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bigtable: the tuples of pairs (key, value) are sorted on the key and sharded among multiple servers based on key ranges. Bigtable provides a write operation that inserts a new tuple automatically and three read operations to retrieve pairs, namely by key, by key prefix or by key range. For each tuple a transaction-time history is recorded.
\item Megastore: On top of bigtable Megastore provides higher level primitives such as consistent secondary indexes, multi-rows transactions, and consistent replication.
\end{itemize}


The motivation for this choice is based on the following features:

\begin{itemize}
\item Export and attribution: We can restrict the ability of others to export the data outside Fusion Tables. We can also control who we share the data with and the data is always carring around the attribution, no matter what transformation gets applied.
\item Search: the public data is made discoverable by search engines, so they can direct users to the data when this is relevant to their queries.
\item Sharing and integration: data can be shared between organizations and can be merged from multiple owners.
\item Visualization: Fusion Tables offers serveral map viewing options for geographic location values and useful visualizations of time data values which occur frequently in our services.
\end{itemize}

Thus, we ensure the availability of information to users, and at the same time we reduce our server load. This way, users can access our database with an extra layer of security and management (instead accessing the database directly). 

This mechanism, and therefore allowing the usage of our system data by third parties, will facilitate the easy creation of web pages and mobile apps to serve useful information to the users.

In this sense, a cross-platform mobile application to allow users access any kind of data using computers, mobile phones and tablets is under development. Figure \ref{fig:f4} shows several screenshots of this application. The application binaries can be found in our server\footnote{\url{http://sipesca.ugr.es/download/descargas/sipesca_info.apk}} and its source code is publicly available on GitHub \footnote{\url{http://github.com/sipesca/appmovil}}.

\end{figure}

\section{Data gathered}
\label{sec:data}
This section shows some data collected during the monitoring period (January 28 to July 13, 2014). The dependency analisys of the number of vehicles related to the number and type of devices will be based on these data. 

Table \ref{table:detections3} shows the total number of BT devices found whilst Table \ref{table:detections4} shows the corresponding amount for wifi devices. Both data are plotted on Figure \ref{fig:btdata} and \ref{fig:wifidata} respectively. 


\begin{table}
\caption{Number of detected BT devices per node.}
\label{table:detections3}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|C{3cm}|R{2cm}|}\hline 
\bfseries  \makebox[3cm][c]{Node Id.} & \bfseries  \makebox[2cm][c]{N. of BT}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{table}

\label{table:detections4}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|C{3cm}|R{2cm}|}\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}



\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/wifiplot}
\end{center}
\caption{Number of Wifi devices detected.}
\label{fig:wifidata}
\end{figure}

Remarkably the amount of wifi devices detected is about 10 times those using BT (exactly 91.8\% of total detections were Wifi) though in most cases the distribution remains similar. In the Figure \ref{fig:btpie} and \ref{fig:wifipie} the observed distribution of detections among the nodes are shown.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/wifipie}
\end{center}
\caption{Distribution of Wifi devices detected among nodes.}
\label{fig:wifipie}
\end{figure}

Finally, a global plot of the average detections between nodes per day is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:average} (note the increase in traffic during Sevilla Fair).

\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/globalaverage}

\caption{Average number of total detections between nodes over the monitoring period.}
\label{fig:average}
\end{figure*}



\section{Future research directions}

Among future improvements to the system, new hardware devices more energy efficient and cheaper will be study. Thus, reducing costs installing new nodes is expected. The hardware team may perform this hardware device evolution and migration to the new model with minimal effort and independently of the software development team.

Additionally, the mobile application to serve information will be improved, allowing users to receive, not only numeric and graphic data, but also alerts on traffic events, such as slow traffic.

Several future research lines have been opened. They are mainly focused on processing the collected data using data mining algorithms \cite{hastie2005elements}, evolutionary computation methods \cite{eiben2003introduction}\cite{michalewicz2004solve}\cite{yang2010nature}, artificial neural networks \cite{castillo2001function}\cite{rivas2003evolving}\cite{castillo2007comparing}, machine learning models \cite{arenas2005co} and statistical methods \cite{han2006data}\cite{lewicki2006statistics}\cite{nisbet2009handbook}, which will be included and integrated as web services \cite{papazoglou2007service}\cite{} in the system. 

The relationship between devices and vehicles and how they vary in time/space will be also studied to obtain more accurate results.

A critical task that any new intelligent transportation system should face is short-term traffic flow prediction. Thus, our purpose is to develop in the future a prediction system that helps to make decisions, and able to apply knowledge in applications related to mobility. In this sense, different time series prediction methods will be used in order to estimate the vehicle passing. Time series forecasting is usually tackled trying to find out an underlying model that describes the series behaviour. Our system will test a variety of methods and include some of them to perform forecast, using both linear and non-linear models \cite{brown1959statistical}\cite{winters1960forecasting}\cite{box2013time}\cite{Tong1978575}\cite{qiu2011generalized}\cite{wang2011comparison}\cite{rivas2004evolving}. 

It is expected that the development and deployment of these systems will offer a set of information services with added value that can not be achieved with current technologies. 

\section{Conclusion}

The information systems currently used for collecting data about the road conditions are not able to identify detected vehicles, and if they do, these information systems have a high cost. In this study, different road types, with different traffic type have been taken into account. 

In this chapter a new low-cost information system to monitor traffic on different road types and in real time has been presented.

The main goal was getting exposure indicators using a new system based on the BT and Wifi devices detection using several collecting nodes. This way, both the traffic density and car journeys have been monitored, identifying the vehicles when they move from one node to another inside the monitored zone.

Moreover, different hardware solutions have been studied to carry out device detection; some of them have been rejected due to their high prices, due to their energy inefficiency or due to their short-range for detection.

Finally, the power and features of the system have been demonstrated. This has been complemented by developing a set of web services based on Google Fusion Tables for easy access to the data in real time, including different statistics.
