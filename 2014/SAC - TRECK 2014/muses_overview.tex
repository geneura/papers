%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.4) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement

% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.

\begin{abstract}
This work presents the description of a novel enterprise security system, still in development, which can deal with the recent situation inside the companies, the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) philosophy. Thus, the Multiplatform Usable Endpoint Security system (MUSES) considers diverse factors such as the information distribution, the type of accesses, the context where the users are, the category of users, or the mix between personal and private data, among others.
This system includes a risk and trust analysis engine to aid in the decision process. MUSES follows a set of defined security rules, according to the enterprise security policies, but it is able to self-adapt the decisions and even create new security rules depending on the user behaviour, the specific device, and the situation or context. To this aim MUSES applies machine learning and computational intelligence techniques which can also be used to perform predictions on potential unsafe or dangerous user's behaviour.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Some years ago, company data were stored in own servers which were accessed by the employees or users by means of desktop or portable computers. Nowadays it is frequent that these data are distributed among multiple machines, even not all belonging to the company, and being consulted and modified through a wide amount of devices, some of them owned by the company's users. This is the so-called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) philosophy. It is becoming highly successful due to the impact that smartphones and tablets are having in the market.
Data security and privacy are key factors for a company, thus, to protect them, it is usual to define Organisational Security Policies. Their definition is nowadays a very difficult problem, since the BYOD tendency means that several factors must be considered \cite{Opp_Security11}, most of them previously ignored or non-considered in the security systems, for instance the current mixture between personal and professional information in these devices (the user could navigate inside social networks where there could be friends and also company partners or clients).

Moreover, it has been demonstrated that people are the main hazard regarding the company security \cite{Adams_Users05}, so in this situation, some monitorization and security-aimed applications are arising. Most of them try to be non-intrusive (regarding the users' personal data), friendly and easy to manage.
This work presents one of these systems, named MUSES, Multiplatform Usable Endpoint Security system. It is being implemented inside an European project and will provide a device independent, user-centric, and self-adaptive corporate security system, able to cope with the concept of seamless working experience on different devices. This concept is a methodology of work which allows users to start/continue a working session over multiple devices and locations without any significant loss of data. This new situation has a big impact from the point of view of the security \cite{Schu_SecPatterns05}, since the company's data borders have changed in the last years so now the users can access significant data from outside the enterprise, and possibly through a non absolutely secure channel.

In this scenario MUSES will analyse the users' behaviour and predict, using computational intelligence methods, risky or dangerous actions regarding both an event correlation and a risk and trust analysis engines. The system will be able to learn from the past user's behaviour, and react in a non-intrusive way to the potentially dangerous sequence of actions that he or she is conducting at any time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   SYSTEM DESCRIPTION   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{System description}
\label{sec:system}

MUSES system will work as presented in Figure \ref{fig:system_overview}. The user interacts with the devices, own or corporate, through the MUSES graphical interface and inside his or her own context (situation, connection, status). This application includes two modules, a \textit{controller} and an \textit{actuator}. The first one monitorizes the environment (context) and the user's behaviour, translating his/her actions into a sequence of events. These events, along with the patterns defining the user's conduct, are processed by the system in real-time by means of a Risk and Trust Analysis Engine (RT2AE) and an Event Correlation module. Then, a decision is taken in the corporate security operations centre (SOC) side, considering the RT2AE output and the set of security rules adapted to that specific user and context. The correspondent feedback is communicated to the user through the \textit{actuator}, which is also in charge of triggering the recommended actions to stop the user's or application's doings, in case it is required.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=system_overview.eps, scale=0.45}
\caption{MUSES system overview.\label{fig:system_overview}}
\end{figure}

The system architecture can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:architecture}. It is a client-server approach in which the \textit{client} program will be installed in every user's device independently of the platform (operative system and type of device). This client contains a \textit{monitorization module}, which gathers the performed sequence of events and user context information; a \textit{controller module} in charge of take some light decisions considering the server response to the current situation (it will also take the control in case the device cannot connect with the server). The device controller will trigger the \textit{actuator} if necessary. This module will provide the user with some feedback, and will interact with the applications being monitorized if recommended or required.

The \textit{server} side would be installed in the corporate SOC. This application contains, in addition to an user interface to manage it, the main modules in the security-aimed decision process: the \textit{RT2AE} and the \textit{Event Correlator}. These components are connected between them and also with the main \textit{Controller}, that will connect with the device side sending the selected set of security rules that better fit with the current situation, along with the actions to be performed according to them.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=architecture.eps, scale=0.38}
\caption{Proposed architecture\label{fig:architecture}}
\end{figure}

One of the main features of the presented system is the self-adaptation (to the user and context) of the set of rules. To this aim, asynchronously to the system working, there will be run a process which will consider the whole amount of historic information regarding user's behaviour and context, and refine it by means of computational intelligence and machine learning techniques. Thus the set of security rules will be adapted to the every user in the system, updating some of the existent rules and creating new ones (always respecting the corporate security policies).
Moreover, some predictive models will be also obtained applying other soft computing techniques, so the user's potentially dangerous behaviour will be anticipated.

\section{MUSES Advantages}
\label{sec:advantages}

%Inside corporate security, and because of the introduction in the companies of the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) philosophy, many projects and products have raised to cover this new situation. MUSES is one of these projects, thus the products that have influenced it and which form a solid State of the Art in BYOD security are going to be presented.

There are available some products similar to MUSES, included in the so-called Software-as-a-Service (known SaaS). The most extended are the IBM's \textit{Hosted Mobile Device Security Management} solution, %\cite{IBM_tool} 
Sophos's \textit{Mobile Control} software solution, 
\cite{Sophos_tool}, 
and the \textit{Bring Your Own Device Solution}
\cite{Good_tool} 
of Good Technology. There are other two important products: one exclusive for Samsung devices, the \textit{KNOX} system,
\cite{Samsung_tool}, 
based on separate environments (personal and corporate, for instance), and one exclusive for Blackberry smartphones, the so called \textit{Blackberry Balance}.
\cite{Blackberry_tool}. 

The main differences with MUSES, is that it will be also a free, open-source, platform independent solution. This is an important advantage because all the existent tools take into account only smartphones and tablets, but MUSES covers laptops and company PCs too. Moreover the companies need specific operative system and server (like Windows Server, for instance). Other big plus of the MUSES system is its new feature of self-adaptiveness. MUSES is able to adapt to changes, either regarding corporate security policies, newly discovered vulnerabilities or threats, different environments of use or user profiles. 

In addition, the existing products are mostly policy-based, but MUSES takes its decisions not only considering policies, but also based on the terminals/users context (location, connected networks and so on), to really understand the real danger of a specific action.
